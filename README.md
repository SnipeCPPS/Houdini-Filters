# Houdini-Filters
This is a simple in-game curse word filter for the Houdini-Asyncio source.

# How to use?
All you need to do is put the *filter.py, blacklist.txt and whitelist.txt* files inside of the **plugins** folder in Houdini-asyncio. 

If you want to add more words to the filter list, just open *blacklist.txt* and add more words into the text file. Same goes with whitelisting words, simple.
